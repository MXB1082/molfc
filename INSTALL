Compilation and Installation
============================

The source code of the program is written in Standard Fortran 90/95 and
F77 standard for Blas libraries, thus in order to compile the code you need a Fortran 90
compiler.

The program has been tested on Xeon and pentium 4/3 machines, using Intel Fortran
Compiler (ifc v. 9.1-15.0).

Open the CMakeLists.txt file using a text editor, 
change the variable you include_directories() to set your options and then use cmake:  

   o tar xvjf molfc3.tar.bz2 (*)

   o cd molfc3/
   
   o cd build/

   o cmake ..

   o make

   o make install

Default settings will place the executable molfc in the directory $HOME/bin.
